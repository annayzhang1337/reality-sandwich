Feeling pretty good about how things have worked out in Seattle

#### Travel-wise
   * Traveled to Oregon, New Mexico, Vancouver, Orcas Island, and most recently, walked down the memory lane in Monterey
   * Next stop? Maybe Mexico City
#### Career-wise
   * Gradually finding footing on my team and trying to add value as much as I can
   * Trying to make money on this new side project
   * Feeling like I need a better grasp of CS fundamentals, but my progress has been stalled by a lack of consistency in my routine. I think I need a good lock-down period after my most recent side project launches. I want to get more comfortable with writing lots of, lots of code (without Cursor!)
#### Investing-wise
  * Sold all my shares in HIMS -- made about 15x on this stock since 2025 but no longer feel comfortable with taking a position in it. Will look for other good opps but will let the cash sit for a while
