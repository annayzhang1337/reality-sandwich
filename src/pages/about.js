            <p>I'm the co-founder & CEO of <a href="https://nessielabs.com" target="_blank">Nessie</a>, a YC-backed startup building personal AI for thought — turning conversations into knowledge that compounds.</p>
            <p>Previously, I engineered large-scale recommendation systems on Amazon's core Personalization team.</p>
            <p>I studied Computer Science at Yale, where I explored how narrative, identity, and technology shape how we think and who we become.</p>
            <p>I believe in building things that help people think and write their own stories — especially when life is messy.</p>

          <h3>Some Things I Believe</h3>
          <ul class="beliefs-list">
            <li><strong>Obsession is a superpower.</strong> The best work comes from a relentless, almost irrational need to solve a problem — the work is learning to aim it well.</li>
            <li><strong>Embrace the mess.</strong> Breakthroughs come from sitting with ambiguity long enough for clarity to emerge.</li>
            <li><strong>Write your own narrative.</strong> If you don't define your story, the world will write a smaller one for you.</li>
            <li><strong>The best moat is an opinion.</strong> Great products are philosophy embedded in software.</li>
            <li><strong>Human stories are the point.</strong> Technology is not the end — it's a tool to expand what makes us human.</li>
            <li><strong>See the world as it is.</strong> Then build the version that should exist.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't take yourself too seriously.</strong> At the end of the day, it's all a beautiful, absurd, infinite game. Laughter is the final form of freedom.</li>
          </ul>
