            <p>I am the co-founder and CEO of Nessie, a YC-backed startup building personal AI to amplify human thought and action.</p>
            <p>Previously, I was an engineer on Amazon's core Personalization team, developing ML-powered recommendation systems for billions of customers.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Yale with a BS in Computer Science, where my interest focused on the intersection of narrative, identity, and technology.</p>
            <p>I believe in building things. I believe in messy, complicated human stories. I believe in finding clarity in the chaos.</p>

          <h3>Some Things I Believe</h3>
          <ul class="beliefs-list">
            <li><strong>Obsession is a Superpower.</strong> The best work comes from a relentless, almost irrational, need to solve a problem. Most of my life has been a process of learning how to aim this engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity is a Choice.</strong> The world is inherently ambiguous and chaotic. The job of a founder -- and a person -- is to create clarity through decisive action and radical honesty.</li>
            <li><strong>You Must Write Your Own Narrative.</strong> If you do not define your own story, the world will happily write a smaller, simpler, and less interesting one for you.</li>
            <li><strong>The Best Moat is a Point of View.</strong> In a world of commoditized technology, the most defensible advantage is a unique, hard-won, and deeply-held worldview. Great products are not just code; they are philosophy embedded in software.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Stories are the Only Ones That Matter.</strong> Technology is not the end. It is a tool. The goal is not to optimize humanity, but to create more space for its messy, beautiful, and inefficient truths.</li>
            <li><strong>The Work is to See the World as It Is.</strong> ...and then have the courage to build the world as it should be.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Take Yourself Too Seriously.</strong> At the end of the day, it's all a beautiful, absurd, and <i>infinite</i> game. The ability to laugh at your own ambition is the final, and most important, form of freedom.</li>
          </ul>
